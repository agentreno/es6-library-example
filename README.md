# es6-library-example

## Description

This is an example of how a library could be structured using ES6
import/export. Webpack takes care of the import/export statements, and runs
Babel as a preprocessor to transpile any ES6 code.

Karma, Mocha, Chai and Sinon are used for testing, with enough config to
generate sourcemaps to diagnose failing tests with the original ES6 code.

As usual, get started with `npm install`, build the project with `npm run
build` and run the tests with `npm run test`.
